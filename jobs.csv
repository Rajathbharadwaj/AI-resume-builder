Micron Technology is a world leader in innovating memory and storage solutions that accelerate the transformation of information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn, communicate and advance faster than ever.

**Our Opportunity Summary**


For more than 45 years, Micron Technology, Inc. has redefined innovation with the world’s most advanced memory and semiconductor technologies. We’re an international team of innovators and scientists, developing groundbreaking technologies that are redefining how the world uses information to enrich life. The solutions we build help make everything from virtual reality experiences to breakthroughs in neural networks possible. We do it all while committing to integrity, sustainability, and giving back to our communities. Because doing so can fuel the very innovation we are pursuing.


Our team vision is a continuing desire to develop your skills working in an inclusive diverse environment of multicultural Teams across worldwide geographies! Enabling the creative career path you deserve with a collaborative environment, and groundbreaking technology while rapidly growing your abilities.


As a Sr. HBM Component Validation Engineer for the DRAM Engineering Group, you will be part of a forward-thinking team of engineers that solves complex problems, responsible for enabling Micron’s products with flawless and issue-free release to both internal and external customers.


In HBM DEG (High Bandwidth Memory, DRAM Engineering Group), we innovate and integrate end-to-end groundbreaking front-end and backend processes with groundbreaking design, debugging various tests, and qualification techniques to develop the lowest power per bit solutions to improve customer experience in the field of ML (Machine Learning) and AI (Artificial Intelligence).The success of a sophisticated product such as HBM relies vastly on vertical integration and the various engineering working in unison.


To provide greater detail, our HBM technology pertains to stacking numbers of DRAM chips along with a logic chip within one package through an assembly technology called TSV (Through Silicon Via). This greatly increases the memory density in a package, while allowing very high-speed signal transmission. Furthermore, ""high bandwidth""; is an outstanding memory design area where custom gate-level design and RTL style logic design are blended into the same product, and most of the DDR or LPDDR design is based on the gate-level design only. Lastly, verification and testing (validation) of HBM is the most ambitious due to the total size of the design and complexity of the functions, and in addition to craft, many innovations are needed for verification and validation of the HBM product, thereby making it uniquely exciting.


Our team vision is a continuing desire to develop your skills working in an inclusive diverse environment of multicultural Teams across worldwide geographies! Enabling the creative career path you deserve with a collaborative environment and groundbreaking technology and growing upon your imagination and creativity.
