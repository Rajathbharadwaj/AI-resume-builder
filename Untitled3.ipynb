       "'Let\\'s think step by step about who the first man on the moon was!\\n\\nStep 1: NASA sent a mission to the moon...\\n\\n* The Apollo program, which ran from 1961 to 1972, was tasked with landing humans on the moon.\\n\\nStep 2: The mission included several manned spaceflights...\\n\\n* Between 1969 and 1972, six manned missions were sent to orbit around the moon (Apollo 7 to Apollo 10). These flights tested equipment, spacecraft systems, and astronaut skills.\\n\\nStep 3: One of these missions was specifically designed for a lunar landing...\\n\\n* Apollo 11, launched on July 16, 1969, was the first mission to land humans on the moon. The crew consisted of three astronauts:\\n\\n\\t+ Neil Armstrong (Commander)\\n\\t+ Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin (Lunar Module Pilot)\\n\\t+ Michael Collins (Command Module Pilot)\\n\\nStep 4: The lunar module Eagle landed on the moon...\\n\\n* On July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), the Eagle lunar module touched down on the moon\\'s surface in the Sea of Tranquility.\\n\\nStep 5: Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon...\\n\\n* At 02:56 UTC on July 21, 1969, Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module and famously declared, \"That\\'s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong!'"
