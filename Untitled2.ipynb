IBM Software helps clients put AI into action now to create real value with trust, speed, and confidence across digital labor, IT automation, application modernization, security, and sustainability. Critical to this is the ability to make use of all data, because AI is only as good as the data that fuels it. In most organizations data is spread across multiple clouds, on premises, in private datacenters, and at the edge. IBMâ€™s AI and data platform scales and accelerates the impact of AI with trusted data, and provides leading capabilities to train, tune and deploy AI across business. IBMâ€™s hybrid cloud platform is one of the most comprehensive and consistent approach to development, security, and operations across hybrid environmentsâ€”a flexible foundation for leveraging data, wherever it resides, to extend AI deep into a business.  \n",
